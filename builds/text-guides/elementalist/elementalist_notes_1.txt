In case of running Elemental Surge due to lack of boons from your party/squad members, equip Arcane spells that will trigger the bonus ferocity from the trait. Preferably take Arcane Brilliance as healing skill also replace Mist Form with Arcane Shield (when you feel that you need that extra survivability) or chose between Arcane Wave (5 target cleave damage with 900 range) and Arcane Blast (for harassing or finishing solo targets from 1500 range) for damage purpose.  If you decide to play with Elemental Surge you probably gonna play off tag, so taking Arcane Shield is preferable, but not mandatory it solely depends on your mechanics and positioning.

                                                Generally it is preferable to play Bountiful Power for the easy damage multiplier.

                                                For your equipment, you can decide to run more or less Marauder gear, based on your own experience on playing Weaver and survivability, you are trading Vitality and Precision for more Power and Ferocity.

Play this only if you really hate so much the change they did to chrono's shatters. If you can play chrono do it, gravity well is better than anything else.
                                            In other case, Chronomancer would still be a better support class with more survivability and CC.
                                            If you struggle, armor can be Marauder, or in case you are fine and want more damage can equip Berserker trinkets.

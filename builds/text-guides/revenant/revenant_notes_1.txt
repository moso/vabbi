As a 1200 range caster, a herald should play around and abuse its range to pressure the enemies from multiple points, while avoiding at all cost bomb areas. Scourges will be your biggest nightmare if you don’t take advantage of your range, so keep in mind, despite your inherit mobility and self-peel, you need to be mindful of your cooldowns and have the awareness of your group’s and enemy’s location. Constantly look for points of free pressure and use your mobility to its fullest making it harder for the enemy to pin you down. Your only focus is staying alive and dealing damage.

                                            Switching these traitlines will trade damage for more group-sustain, reducing damage taken in certain situations for yourself and applying longer Stability for you and the party. Additionally when using the Dwarf's elite skill "Rite of the Great Dwarf", you will provide additional 50% damage reduction from conditions. Only use in case of bad group sustain but not lacking group damage.

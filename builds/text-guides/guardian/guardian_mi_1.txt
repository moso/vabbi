                                                Calculation of how much Merciful Intervention (MI) heals downed players.
    
                                                MI heals downstate players in two parts: 20% of their downed health plus the skill's normal healing effect. Outgoing healing modifiers affect both of these components, however, healing power only scales with the latter.
    
                                                <b>CALCULATION FORMULA</b>
    
                                                <u>Amount MI will heal a downstate player</u> = [(mechanic-specific base heal + healing power * mechanic-specific coefficient) * (1 + sum of healing multipliers)] + [(3 * profession base health * 0.2 * (1+ sum of healing multipliers)]
    
                                                <u>Percentage of ally health bar restored</u> = (amount MI will heal a downstate player) / (3 * profession base health) * 100
    
                                                <b>DATA</b>
    
                                                Mechanic-specific base heal for MI is (40 + Level^2 * 0.36)
    
                                                <u>Small Healthpool</u> is 11645 for Guardian, Thief, and Elementalist.
                                                <u>Medium Healthpool</u> is 15922 for Revenant, Engineer, Ranger, and Mesmer.
                                                <u>Large Healthpool</u> is 19212 for Warrior and Necromancer.

                                                My commander is a Firebrand. My commander goes down and is afflicted with poison while in downstate. As long as I use MI before his downstate health reaches 43.7%, I can instantly resurrect him.
    
                                                My commander is a Warrior. My commander goes down. My commander is not poisoned. As long as I use MI before his downstate health reaches 42.9%, I can instantly resurrect him.
    
                                                My commander is a Mesmer. My commander goes down and is afflicted with poison while in downstate. As long as I use MI before his downstate health reaches 49.3%, I can instantly resurrect him.
    
                                                <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>
    
                                                <u>How much does MI heal downed players for?</u> It depends. Its effectiveness drops significantly without outgoing healing modifiers and when poison is involved. Based on a realistic situation in WvW (one player is poisoned), MI can restore about half a downed player's health.
                                                <u>How much Healing Power is needed to guarantee a resurrection?</u> There is not enough outgoing healing or healing power in the game to guarantee a resurrection with MI every time
    
                                                Firebrands should, obviously, use MI as soon as possible to secure resurrections.
                                                Benevolence Sigil is better than Life Sigil for MI.
                                                MI effectiveness drops significantly with less outgoing healing modifiers and whenever poison is involved.
                                                There is not enough outgoing healing or healing power in the game to guarantee a resurrection with MI every time.

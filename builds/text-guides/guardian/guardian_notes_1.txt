<b>TRAITLINES AND TRAITS</b>

												<b>HONOR</b>

												Honor has overal good synergy with Firebrandis kit.

												<i>Baseline traits:</i>

												<u>Vigorous Precision</u>: Doesn't have a huge impact, however extra vigor is always nice. Theres a posibility for 100% uptime, however due to other sources of vigor, i is not really necessary to think about this too much. Also huge downside is that its personal only.
												<u>Selfless Daring</u>: Used to be one of the biggest sources of healing of guardians pre-pof. Still its a very strong healing trait, considering it has a 5 people target cap and is (almost) instant. This trait itself has 1.0 healing power scaling. However it has 240 radius, which is not the worst, but not so godtier, in the end we get it for free and thats important.
												<u>Purity of Body</u>: Has the exact same synergy with virtues traitline we use as its written. 15% endurance regeneration bonus at all times (later on that in Virtues).

												<i>Minor traits:</i>

												<u>Invigorated Bulwark (pick)</u>: It has good synergy with mace overal but the most important thing is the active proc. You can easily maintain 5 stacks during the fight and that should be your goal. 25% outgoing healing is actually the biggest outgoing healing boost you can get on firebrand and the numbers are INSANE. Firebrand has a lot of blocks mainly coming from aegis, but also from mace skill 3, which you can use as a filler just to keep the trait up.
												<u>Protective Reviver</u>: Used to be our go to trait pre-pof and in my opinion is still a very strong trait for fast resses. Also the boons you apply to the ressed person, the cc and small heal it provides.
												<u>Protector's Impact</u>: Has no place in a non roaming scenario.

												<i>Major traits:</i>

												<u>Honorable Staff</u>: Used to be go-to pre-pof. Doesnt have a lot of value at the moment because we have more than enough concentration and simply the 20% staff skill cd isnt worth it. For example, picking this trait would make our Line of Warding (staff 5) have 24 sec cd, which would line up perfectly with f5 from shadespike, however line is not that strong cc and is very easy to avoid. Might from Empower (staff 4) already has 18 second duration, which means around 2 seconds downtime on 12 stacks of might. Also our boon duration is fixed by what sigils we pick.
												<u>Pure of Heart (pick)</u>: Also the reason we don't pick Honorable Staff. As said before, we have a lot of aegis application skills and Pure of Heart has no icd or target limit. Remember that healing from aegis on other players is multiplied by your increased outgoing healing effectiveness. To use this trait correctly and get 100% out of it is very difficult, but training makes you better at things. My tip here is: DO NOT OVERLAP AEGIS ON YOUR ALLIES. Spamming aegis granting skills on allies is nice, but to get 100% out of this trait, you want the aegis to proc. Aegis proc means healing and damage mitigation.
												<u>Empowering might</u>: 1 sec icd, also in comparison to other traits, its pve tier. Do. Not. Look. At. This. Trait.

												<i>Grandmaster traits:</i>

												<u>Pure of Voicee</u>: Used to be our go-to trait pre-pof because of stability rotations in 2-guardian parties. Not very valuable, since we have a lot of other stability sources as well as condition cleanse. Also we don't play shouts. (duh)
												<u>Writ of Persistence</u>: Makes your symbols heal a bit. Has literally 0 value. If you are not in a symbol, you are not getting healed, also the heal is equal to almost 1/3 of your regeneration tick. Bully people that play this trait.
												<u>Force of Will (pick)</u>: 1% more outgoing healing per 100 vitality. Thats 19% outgoing healing effectiveness right there. Not saying +300 vitality is very begginer friendly and makes you a lot tankier, it also stacks with the outgoing healing increase.

												<b>VIRTUES</b>

												Tomes = Virtues. Enchants your tome pops as well as tome skills.

												<i>Baseline traits:</i>

												<u>Inspired Virtue</u>: 5 target boon-share within 1200 radius. I would say most value has the protection on Tome of Courage. Inspired Virtue gets triggered once you pop one of your tomes.
												<u>Virtue of Retribution</u>: Grants us retaliation, buffs the duration of retaliation. Very nice offensive buff.
												<u>Power of the Virtuous</u>: This is a huge baseline trait, the damage itself doesnt really matter. However 15% cd reduction on our tomes is just increasing our tome potential.

												<i>Minor traits:</i>
												<u>Unscathed Contender</u>: we are not a dps class, we ignore this trait in a non roaming scenario.
												<u>Retaliatory Subconscious (pick)</u>: Does exactly what it says, grants us retal and aegis when disabled. (Stun, daze, etc.) The only problem is it has 30 sec icd, however that doesnt really matter, because its still better than the other two traits. GO-TO.
												<u>Master of Consecrations</u>: used to be our go-to talent pre-pof, because of purging flames/wall of reflection. At the moment, we don't use any Consecration skill which makes this trait worthless.

												<i>Major traits:</i>

												<u>Virtous Solace</u>: 75sec internal cooldown, small heal, and procs below 25% health. Just ignore this.
												<u>Absolute Resolution (pick)</u>: Makes your Virtue of Resolve passive healing 25% stronger and makes your Tome of Resolve pop cleanse 3 conditions on 5 targets within 600 radius.
												<u>Glacial Heart</u>: Is a hammer specific trait, not interesting for non roaming scenario.

												<i>Grandmaster traits:</i>

												<u>Permeating Wrath</u>: Again, we aren't a dps class. Ignore this.
												<u>Battle Presence (pick)</u>: Has biggest value at the moment. Makes your Virtue of Resolve passive healing heal your allies around you in a 600 radius. Target cap is 5. Priority are your party members. Go-to trait.
												<u>Indomitable Courage</u>: Used to be our go-to trait pre-pof. 3 stacks of stability, AoE stunbreak. 600 radius on 5 targets. However not very valuable at the moment, since we have a lot of other sources of stability and Battle Presence healing is just much better. Tip: if you somehow have 2 firebrands in 1 party, one of you can pick this trait for extra utility.

												<b>FIREBRAND</b>

												Elite specialization which we pick because of its big heals, party boons and survivability.

												<i>Baseline traits:</i>

												<u>Purity of Word</u>: Basically turns your virtues into tomes and gives you ability to use mantras.
												<u>Swift Scholar</u>: Almost on demand personal quickness boost. You can use this proc for a quick empower after stowing a tome or just casting certain skills in tomes faster. I will explain usage of this trait later.
												<u>Imbued Haste</u>: Great synergy with Swift Scholar, however not very strong if you're playing in a group that doesnt have access to quickness. (no mesmer) However don't forget that slow condition converts to quickness aswell.

												<i>Minor traits:</i>

												<u>Unrelenting Criticism</u>: Axe specific trait, might have some use in smaller scale scenarios, however the only benefit is the daze from initial symbol strike. Anyway, do not pick this trait.
												<u>Liberators Vow</u>: Might be interesting for smaller scale again, however its offensive and it has 8 sec icd. So no-go.
												<u>Archivist of Whispers (pick)</u>: Grants your tomes 3 more pages to 8 total. Go-to. Utility wise outscales other traits. This is too big to not pick.

												<i>Major traits: READ LATEST PATCH NOTES FOR MORE INFOS</i>

												<u>Weighty Terms</u>: Offensive trait. Not for us. Also 10 sec icd.
												<u>Stalwart Speed (pick)</u>: Used to have 5 sec icd, which was pretty strong and made your damage flow much faster, however since it got nerfed by 60% and is as said before -offensive-, we do not pick this trait.
												<u>Legendary Lore</u>: Biggest tome buff ever. Helps your courage tome with protection uptime. Helps your resolve tome with regeneration uptime. This gives every skill in your tomes additional effect. The burning duration increase is nice ofc, but its not really necessary. It would be our go-to even if the justice tome buff wasnt there. Use this wisely however, because spamming more than X amount of skills disables the protection/regeneration granting for a short duration.

												<i>Grandmaster traits:</i>

												<u>Stoic Demeaor</u>: Interesting for roaming.
												<u>Quickfire</u>: Is an offensive trait. We don't pick this.
												<u>Loremaster (pick)</u>: Reduced recharge on tome skills. 33% is a lot. This also enables our Virtue of Resolve passive healing effect as well as all its bonuses. (15% endurance regen)

												So that wraps it up for the traits. There is a variant to substitute virtues with Valor, however thats a very selfish build that might be interesting for begginers somehow, but it doesnt synergise with other traits.
												Traits in Valor would be Smiters boon for personal condition cleanse, Strength in numbers for the extra toughness, Altruistic Healing for a huge self healing potential.
												THIS VARIANT IS NOT AS GROUP SUPPORTIVE AS VIRTUES VARIANT! AS A COMMANDER YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TAKING 2ND FIREBRAND INTO YOUR PARTY AND RUN VALOR IF YOU FEEL TO MUCH PRESSURE ON YOUR FACE!

												<b>GEARS</b>

												This is a guide for full support firebrand which means we need to gear with armor that provides us:

												<u>Healing Power</u>: More powerfull heals
												<u>Boon Duration</u>: Boons lasting longer
												<u>Toughness</u>: Tankiness to survive spike damage
												<u>Vitality</u>: Against conditions pressure that can't be cleansed and to make our Force of Will stronger.

												Thats exactly what Minstrel gears give us.

												<b>WEAPONS</b>

												You should get yourself a Staff, Mace, Axe, Shield, Greatsword and Hammer.
												Every weapon has its utility. Ask your commander what he wants you to use.

												So we equip ourselves with full Minstrel gear. Thats the simple part.

												<b>RUNES</b>

												So most common and the strongest rune in terms of party support and healing balance is going to be Monk Rune.
												Gives us Boon Duration, Healing power and 10% outgoing healing effectiveness and another up to 10% outgoing healing effectiveness.
												If you don't have Ascalonian Tears to buy monk runes, Water runes will do for the moment. However you should aim to get monk runes asap.
												If you are a begginer and you are still learning the class (as in you actually have no clue what to press) go with Durability runes for extra self tankiness. However they are not popular that much anymore, since the amount of healing Monk Runes provides is just way better.

												<b>SIGILS</b>

												On both weapon sets you need to get an Energy Sigil. Remember that stowing a tome also procs the Energy Sigil, so the icd might not be up once you swap weapons. Icd of most sigils with on weapon swap effects is 9 seconds – full weapon swap cooldown.

												As second sigil there are 4 options:
												1. <u>Concentration sigil</u>: Boon duration is increased by 10% permanently. (Which is „meh“ in comparison to the one we had before)
												2. <u>Transference sigil</u>: 10% more outgoing healing effectiveness. It basically makes your heals even stronger. Since the recent concentration sigil nerf, this is our go-to sigil at the moment.
												3. <u>Life sigil</u>: Grants you +10 healing power every kill up to 25 stacks (250 healing power).
												4. <u>Benevolence sigil</u>: Increases 0.5% healing effectiveness every kill up to 25 stacks (12,5% effectiveness). This is different than healing power.

												<b>INFUSIONS</b>

												<u>Healing infusions</u>: All you can. 90 healing power outscales the 0.9% outgoing healing effectiveness from Force of Will if you would think about taking vitality infusions.

												<b>FOODS AND ENHANCEMENTS</b>

												Some people think food and enhancement is just a small boost to class effectiveness. Thats party true, because some stats have less value than others. However its a buff and it should be used 24/7.
												On Firebrand, we pick food and enhancement buffs that are far more valuable than any other food is.
												There would be some options for guys that are unable to get certain food buffs or enhancements buffs.

												<i>"A-tier“ GROUP HEALING SUPPORT:</i>

												<u>Delicious Rice Balls</u>: 100 healing power, 10% outgoing healing effectiveness.
												<u>Bountiful Maintenance oil</u>: Outgoing Healing effectiveness increase. This scales with Rice Ball flat amount aswell. – THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT UTILITY BUFF!!!!!

												<i>Defensive food:</i>

												<u>Bowl of Curry Mussel Soup</u>: -10% power damage, -5% conditions damage.
												<u>Oysters with Pesto Sauce</u>: might be interesting if you are doing well on conditions cleanses or enemy group runs power heavy.

												<i>Optional food:</i>

												<u>Plate of Mussels Gnashblade</u>
												<u>Magnanimous Maintenance Oil</u>

												This option would cap you at 70% boon duration.
												Problem with this boon duration set up is the healing power loss. And thats why this sucks. Please do not run this exact food and enhancement.

												That wraps it up for gearing, lets move onto skill explanation.

												<b>SKILLS</b>

												We will start with utilities we will be using at 99% of the time.

												<i>HEALING SKILL</i>

												<u>Mantra of Solace</u>: 30 second cooldown. 3 charges, 12 sec recharge. Grants aegis to allies hit on use.
												Healing mantra is the strongest healing skill in my opinion. Do not spam the mantra on 1 target. Aegis heals you and allies. Rather wait for the aegis pop if you can afford it to get the extra heal.
												Avoid using 3rd charge unless you really need to use it to save someones life.

												<i>ELITE SKILL</i>

												<u>Mantra of Liberation</u>: 40 second cooldown. 3 charges, 25 sec recharge. This is one of your stability sources but you should save the charges as a breakstun option for yourself and your party members. First 2 charges give 1 stack, last gives 5 stacks for longer duration. The important part about this mantra is that it breaks stuns for you and allies nearby. Utilise the third charge of the mantra only in case you are about to die or someone from party is, you don't want to have the elite mantra un full cooldown. Consider the stacks of stability as an additional bonus, use the mantra as a breakstun to save yourself and other people.

												<i>UTILITY SKILLS</i>

												<u>Mantra of Lore</u>: 25 second cooldown. 3 charges, 12 sec recharge. This is your out of tome on demand conditions cleanse and regeneration. First 2 charges removes 2 conditions, last charge CONVERTS 5 conditions into boons. Since there are a lot of conditions and boons corrupts/removal in the game right now, try to keep the mantra as long as possible without recharging. However do not hesitate to press the last charge if you are in great danger.
												<u>Merciful Intervention</u>: 40 second cooldown. 20% revive percentage. However, outgoing healing effectiveness increases these 20%, so you can instares someone who goes down when buffed enough with 1 MI. Should be saved for fast and safe resses. Do not forget about its healing flat amount. Selfcasting MI can result in a huge 7k heal on non-downed allies preventing them falling down.
												<u>Stand Your Ground</u>: Our good old stability. 30 second cooldown, 9,5 sec duration w/o concentration sigil proc. Also a self stunbreak.

												These are the main utilities you should be using on a firebrand.

												<b>WEAPON SKILLS</b>

												Every weapon has its own pros and cons in different scenarios. If you are starting from scratch, id recommend getting a Staff and Mace/Shield first, since this should be our most used „combo“ of weapons.

												<i>STAFF</i>

												1 – <u>Bolt of Wrath</u>: Recently got changed to range, deals no significant amount of damage. Decent for tagging bags.
												2 – <u>Holy Strike</u>: Has 4 pulses on 5 targets. Heals for a significant amount. 8 second cooldown. Use on cooldown. Use mostly for healing on allies. Also its a blast, which can help us in blasting waters etc. However most of the times you are going to see "Area cleanse condition“, because of the light combo fields.
												3 – <u>Symbol of Swiftness</u>: Our main source of swiftness, use on cooldown or on commanders call. Can help you keeping up your monk rune proc.
												4 – <u>Empower</u>: 12 might stacks to 5 allies aswell as pretty huge heal. The only downside to this is that you are unable to move during the cast. Should be used on commanders call, however noones gonna rip off your head if you empower in a safe spot.
												5 – <u>Line of Warding (Line)</u>: Our long range cc skill. Hits 10 targets. Interrupts on crossing or removes 1 stability stack from the enemy. Use it on commander's call for Line/CC. Aim to interrupt enemies out of position/backline if you are not synced with the commander's line.

												<i>MACE</i>

												Mace is a defensive main hand option.

												1 – <u>True Strike</u>: Chain takes very long, however 3rd attack heals for a bit. Use wisely on melee cleave on downs for some extra sustain etc.
												2 – <u>Symbol of Faith</u>: Just like Symbol of Swiftness, this time applies regeneration instead of swiftness, used for monk rune uptime, granting regeneration on regroups, has a small cleave potential.
												3 – <u>Protectors Strike</u>: Decent damage burst. Grants us and allies protection and aegis. Procs on enemy attack towards you.

												<i>SHIELD</i>

												Our only viable offhand option for our build.

												4 – <u>Shield of Judgement</u>: Applies aegis and protection in a cone in front of you to you and 4 allies. Deals a small amount of damage. Should be use on cooldown with main focus on giving protection and aegis to allies.
												5 – <u>Shield of Absorption</u>: Destroys projectiles during casting. Knocks back enemies or strips a stack of stability. The pop skill heals for a small amount, however has huge aoe and is instant. Mainly use as a filler.

												<i>AXE</i>

												Axe is our aggressive main hand option.

												1 – <u>Core Cleave</u>: Causes conditions to enemies hit, has a good cleave potential, since third strike in AA chain hits like a truck.
												2 – <u>Symbol of Vengeance</u>: Very decent cleave potential, applies cripple to enemies. Should be dropped on enemy downed players to create some pressure.
												3 – <u>Blazing Edge</u>: A 600 range pull on 3 targets in a cone in front of you. Very strong in terms of CC. Should be used while melee engaging stabless enemies or catching a focused target.

												<i>HAMMER</i>

												Hammer is currently the least played weapon, because of the small amount of group support the weapon has and because of very small amount of melee engagements in the current meta.

												1 – <u>Hammer Swing</u>: Again, third AA in the chain drops a symbol that applies protection to allies, however takes forever to cast. Use wisely.
												2 – <u>Mighty Blow</u>: Used to be our melee spike skill. It can still hit pretty hard considering we are full minstrel. It is a blast. Use it on cooldown.
												3 – <u>Zealots Embrace (Immobilize)</u>: Our immobility source. Fires a projectile that immobilizes enemies in front of you in up to 1200 range. However the projectile can be reflected, so watch out for reflects.
												4 – <u>Banish</u>: Is our single target downstate cc. Used to be main downstate finishing skill earlier.
												5 – <u>Ring of Warding (Ring)</u>: Name speaks for itself. Casts a ring below your feet. CCs up to 10 targets. However you need to go very melee on your enemies to be able to catch someone.

												<i>GREATSWORD</i>

												Second least played weapon, I personally like greatsword a lot, because of the possibility of leaping and pulling enemy range. Also its fun. However greatsword has no support potential and should be mostly used for tagging bags while farming enemy. (Actually pretty good at it.)

												1 – <u>Strike</u>: Third attack applies up to 3 stacks of might, depends on how many enemies you’ve hit.
												2 – <u>Whirling Wrath</u>: Spin around. 7 Hits. Don’t cast on living enemy melee train. You are going to kill yourself because of retaliation. Tag the bags though. GODLIKE cleave.
												3 – <u>Leap of Faith</u>: DO NOT LEAP INTO ENEMY BOMB. Leap into enemys backline. But rather just don’t leap. Unless the commander calls for it. You can use it as a mobility skill to catch up to your melee, if you fell behind.
												4 – <u>Symbol of Wrath</u>: Retaliation source, some cleave potential here. Drop on downs.
												5 – <u>Binding Blade</u>: The only reason id play greatsword is 3-5 combo. This pulls up to 5 enemies towards you. Great for cleaning up backline.

												So thats it for weapons and their skills. Honestly in the current meta the most viable option is Mace Shield/Staff. You should be running this 99% of the time. More in gameplay section.

												<b>TOMES</b>

												Believe me or not, we are spending way too much time in tomes during fight. Some of the tome skills are incredibly good, some of them just suck. (jk theyre all pretty decent)

												<i>TOME OF JUSTICE</i>

												Offensive oriented tome. Use for tagging dead enemy or to cc.

												1 – <u>Chapter 1: Searing Spell</u>: Applies burning, deals nice amount of damage in a cone in front of you. 600 range. Basically improved our old staff 1.
												2 – <u>Chapter 2: Igniting Burst</u>: Applies weakness and burning in a small radius around you. Deals small amount of damage.
												3 – <u>Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke (Pull)</u>: Is our mid range pull. 900 range. Good thing is that it has a pretty decent aoe. Use to CC enemies on commanders call, otherwise call out that you are pulling yourself.
												4 – <u>Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath</u>: Applies bleeding and burning in a middle radius around you. Deals some damage. Use mainly to tag bags. Also its a fire field.
												5 – <u>Epilogue: Ashes of the Just (Ashes)</u>: Grats you and allies a buff that makes your next 3 attacks burn the enemy. Allies with this buff apply the burning stacks that count as your own damage, which means its very good for tagging bags. Should be used on cooldown. (if you ever stay in fire tome longer than first cast)

												<i>TOME OF RESOLVE</i>

												Healing oriented tome.

												1 – <u>Chapter 1: Desert Bloom</u>: Heals you and 4 other allies in a cone in front of you within 600 range. Reliable source of quick healing.
												2 – <u>Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery</u>: Cleanses 2 conditions, heals for the amount of conditions cleansed around you. Has a small radius, so keep in mind that this is rather casted mostly in melee.
												3 – <u>Chapter 3: Azure Sun</u>: Works same way as Justice Tomes 3rd skill, however Azure Sun doesnt pull. Instead it grants vigor, regen and swiftness to allies hit. Wouldnt recommend casting too often.
												4 – <u>Chapter 4: Shining River</u>: Our waterfield. Heals for a good amount within large area and grants us swiftness. Use on regroups.
												5 – <u>Epilogue: Eternal Oasis</u>: Converts 5 conditions on you and 4 nearby allies within 600 radius. Our major condition cleanse/conversion. Also grants us 20% increased healing effectiveness. Should be used on cooldown, however do not waste it on allies without conditions.

												<i>TOME OUF COURAGE</i>

												Boons oriented tome.

												1 – <u>Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge</u>: Grants 1 stack of stability and swiftness. 600 range, cone in front, just as other #1 skills in tomes. Avoid using, unless you/your allies really need fast stability.
												2 – <u>Chapter 2: Daring Challenge</u>: Grants aegis and taunts enemies. Reliable source of aegis on melee pushes due to fast casttime aswell as pressure from the cc and small amount of damage.
												3 – <u>Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark (Reflect)</u>: Creates a small bubble that reflects projectiles to enemies. Use while being pressured by range.
												4 – <u>Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand (Resistance)</u>: Our only source of resistence, however very reliable, because of the huge radius. Also stunbreaks you. Use while moving to ignore movement speed reduction conditions (cripple and chill) and to remove some condition pressure from you and allies.
												5 – <u>Epilogue: Unbroken Lines (Toughness)</u>: Grants temporal toughness buff to you and allies as well as granting Protection, Stability and Retaliation. 600 radius. Use whenever available off cooldown.

												Remember that every tome skill has its own benefit from Legendary Lore trait. The burning duration on Justice doesnt really matter, however Regeneration on Resolve and Protection on Courage helps a lot as additional buff. Keep in mind that this has a hidden icd after few casts, so spamming skills in Courage until you are dried out wont get you most Protection uptime. Also remember that Tomes are currently our strongest part of the kit, so use them wisely and do not waste them out.

												So that wraps it up for the whole trait, equip and skill explanation, lets move onto the How to play section.

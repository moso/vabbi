														Your main role as a scourge is to <b>CORRUPT BOONS</b> and it's <b>NOT to deal damage</b> to the enemy. THE DAMAGE IS GOOD BUT IS NOT THE MAIN ROLE. Necromancer since the start of the game was used for its Well of Corruption to remove Stability from the enemy's melee train, on top of that you had the damage from running Berserker Stats. If you are looking for a DPS only build, you should play Weaver or Caster Herald.
												
														We prioritize corrupts over damage and so you should do. The calculation for optimal corrupts is the following:
		
														Manifest Sand Shade: 1 corrupt x5 targets = 5
														Nefarious Favor: 1 corrupt x5 targets = 5 - In case of melee range hitting 10 targets you deal 10 corrupts with the shade on the ground and the one on yourself.
														Devouring Darkness: 3 corrupts x5 targets = 15 
														Enfeebling Blood: 1 corrupt x5 targets = 5
														Well of Corruption: 1 corrupt x5 targets x5 ticks = 25
														Trail of Anguish: 1 corrupt (unlimited targets?) = 1+
														Ghastly Breach: 1 corrupt x5 targets x5 ticks = 25
														Additional:
														Spinal Shivers: 3 corrupts x1 target = 3
														Sand Flare: 1 corrupt x5 targets = 5
				
														The total ammount of possible corrupts/boons removed by casting everything listed above ONLY ONCE would be 104 (considering only 1 corrupt from trail of anguish). In a fight most likely you won't hit the maximum ammounts of targets with every skill, and other Scourges can corrupt boons before you do but generally you want about 60 to 90 corrupts per minute (since these skills are available multiple times within 60 seconds).
				
														This build should be your standard build to run when you are able to reach 900 range to cast shades, scepter skills, axe and wells without too much counter pressure on you.

												This build has a quite specific usage which is for organized blob vs blob fights in open field spots like the gvg areas (generally south camp zone).
	
												You have to keep in mind that your role doesn't change from was is said in the other's build notes which is to corrupt boons and the damage is optional, but in this case you have a Staff instead of Axe + Torch/Focus for the 1200 range pressure with marks.
												Marks in this situations are quite important because they are a good source of ranged pressure without too much risk of getting downstate. Here is an example:
	
												With the other build, your max range skills are 900 (bit more considering the aoe radious but irrelevant), trying to pressure with 900 range skills is way harder in hard fights that result in mostly pirateship-style fight because unable to engage with melee due to the high pressure from ranged. Your marks are part of this pressure along Weavers' Staff and Caster Heralds with Hammers.
												Reaching 900 range in that kind of situation will result in you getting downstate most likely due to the Herald's Coalescence of Ruin, Phase Smash, Drop the Hammer, Scourge's marks, Weavers Lava Font, Meteor Shower etc.
	
												Your job is to make it hot for the enemy to engage you, just like they are making it hot for you to engage them, and catch people off guard that will end up in your damage and getting killed.
	
												Along with the pressure itself you can also manipulate the enemy movement to your benefit, coordinating with your other ranged classes, creating opening for your group to push, pressuring them to end up with the back againt a wall and other situations that give you an advantage over the fight.

												The above can be combined in several ways, I will list some of the more common ways:
												- Small bomb/pressure/spike: Manifest Shade -> Devouring Darkness and Nefarious Favor (you can F2-F5 during casting other skills, such as Devouring Darkness) + Sand Cascade (F3, extra damage and barrier). In case of being unable to engage in 900 range use Staff Marks for small pressure (don't waste #4 #5).
												- Big bomb/pressure/spike: Well of Corruption and Well of Suffering, replace Manifest Sand Shade and go for a full bomb with the other shades (Nefarious Favor, Sand Cascade and Desert Shroud) and try to keep Garish Pillar for last, in case of people getting ressed, this way you can fear and torment the reviver.
												- If you are melee engaging and the situation allows in place Ghastly Breach. In case you have Sand Swell instead of Well of Suffering you can portal inside/behind them and cast it as they backpedal/push and then port back.
												- Use Devouring Darkness in combination with any of these bombs, try to prioritize this skill since it corrupts the most boons, using it on the enemy melee train is the most effective.
												- Try to combine corrupts as much as possible, more corrupts at the same time makes them weaker but it can also prevent them from pushing you, making the fight become stall and pirateship-ish.
	
												<b>WEAPON SKILLS TIPS:</b>
	
												Scepter tips:
												- Use #1 on anyone in range, gives annoying conditions to be cleansed.
												- Use #2 as AoE damage, so in combination with any of the shade spikes, it does considerable amount of damage and cripples the people trying to exit your bomb.
												- Use #3 whenever in range and whenever you can combine it with your corrupt spikes on their melee train. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxbA2gc5gy0" target="_blank">Click for referance</a>
	
												Dagger tips:
												- Save #4 for cleanse, keep in mind it can get reflected, blocked and dodged though (and generally has bad line of sight).
												- Use #5 in combination with Devouring Darkness, you will have to precast it where the enemy is about to go because of the cast time and animation to land on the ground.
	
												Staff tips:
	
												- Use #2 #3 for pressure, #3 on downed people makes them getting ressed slowly because of the poison, and generally reduce the healing of everyone afflicted by it.
												- Save #4 to cleanse your conditions, in hard fights this will be really important.
												- Use #5 to CC ranged/people getting ressed and general pressure, traited it also gives torment.
	
												<b>UTILITY SKILLS TIPS:</b>
	
												- Use Sand Flare in hard engages to give your party barrier and corrupt 1 boon as additional annoyance for the enemy (not always reccomanded but good party support). <a href="https://youtu.be/hNt1o1-LogA" target="_blank">Click for referance.</a>
												- Use your Wells when the commander asks for a Well Bomb or a Big spike or something similar, don't use them for small pressure.
												- Use Trail of Anguish when CC'd and in a dangerous situation im which care, if you didn't use it, you would go downstate and/or die. <a href="https://youtu.be/EPzFXhU2vFs" target="_blank">Click for referance.</a>
												- Use Ghastly Breach behind them if they're backpedaling or on your group if they are pushing you. You can combine it with Sand Swell as stated above.
	
												Additional
	
												- Use Corrupt Boon on melee train if equipped, has low cooldown and removes a lot of boons with just 2 charges.
												- Use Poison Cloud if you want to destroy enemy's projectiles, protecting you from Heralds' Hammer Bolts, Weavers' Fireball and other forms of projectiles.
												- Use Sand Swell to save yourself in case of bad movements happening. Be aware not to cast it on downstates, you might kill your squad members.
	
												<b>GENERAL TIPS:</b>
	
												- Barrier removes conditions from yourself and party members, if you see someone low and with conditions you can use Sand Flare on the person and f3 to cleanse conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hNt1o1-LogA" target="_blank">Click for referance.</a>
												- If you are in melee range and ran out of F1 charges it's not too bad to use the shade skills without a F1 casted, less effective but still good.
